    <h4 class="how-to-heading">MEMORY GAME - How to play</h4>
    <p>This game checks if you can remember the clicking pattern you followed 
      previously.
    </p>
    <p>When the game opens, you start the game by pressing a key on the keyboard 
      if you are using a computer or clicking/touching the 'START' button.
    </p>
    <p>When the game starts, any one of the four boxes (green, red, yellow 
      or blue) will blink. This gives you the particular box you are 
      to click to progress to level 2.
    </p>
    <p>When you correctly click this box that blinked, you will see level 2 on top 
      and yet another box will randomly blink. There is a shaking animation of the 
      box you clicked.
    </p>
    <p>Your level tells you how many times you are to click. In level 2, 
      you are expected to click the first box that blinked followed by 
      the new one that just blinked. If you get this correctly you will progress 
      to level 3.
    </p>
    <p>In level 3, a new box randomly blinks. Then you click the first box 
      that blinked, followed by the second and the third in that sequence. You have 
      to memorize the pattern.
    </p>
    <p>Whenever you click or touch any box, the box will flash a white light as it shakes. 
      This differenciates it from the blinking of one box at the start of every level.
    </p>
    <p>That is basically what you do in the game. The sounds will also guide you.</p>
    <P>SUMMARY</P>
    <p>- Your current level tells you how many times you are to click. If your level is 4, 
      you are clicking 4 times to make it to the next level. If you are in level 7, your clicking pattern
       should also be 7 clicks long and so on.
    </p>
    <p>- The last box that blinked is the last box you are going to click 
      in your pattern or sequence.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
