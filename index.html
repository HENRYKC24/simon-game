    <p>This game checks if you can remeber the clicking pattern you followed 
      previously.
    </p>
    <p>When the game opens, you start the game by pressing a key on the keyboard 
      if you are using a computer or touching the blue background
       if you are using a phone or tablet.
    </p>
    <p>When the game starts, any one of the four boxes (green, red, yellow 
      or blue) will blink. This gives you the particular box you are 
      to click to progress to level 2.
    </p>
    <p>When you rightly clicked this box that blinked, you will see level 2 on top 
      and yet another box will randomly blink.
    </p>
    <p>The level you are tells you how many boxes you are to click. In leve 2, 
      you are expected to click the first box that blinked followed by 
      the new one that just blinked. If you get this correctly you will progress 
      to level 3.
    </p>
    <p>In level 3, a new box randomly blinks. Then you click the first box 
      that blinked, followed by the second and the third in that sequence.
    </p>
    <p>Whenever you click or touch any box, the box will flash a white light. 
      This differenciates it from the blinking of one box at the start of every level.
    </p>
    <p>That is basically what you do in the game. The sounds will also guide you.</p>
